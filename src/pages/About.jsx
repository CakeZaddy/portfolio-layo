            How I Started Social Media Marketing?

            <p className=''>
              During my university placement year at Xerox Europe, I was asked
              to join their exciting new social media group. Social media was
              only just starting to grab the attention of businesses, and it was
              here I realised this was my passion and I made it my career. I’ve
              never looked back since!

              After graduating with a 1st from Bournemouth University, I joined
              De Vere Hotels, where I completely fell in love with the
              hospitality industry. I was a social media team of one, so I was
              kept very busy, and it required lots of self-learning! I developed
              their social media brand guidelines and successfully managed their
              brand-level social media accounts. I also worked with each hotel
              to establish its own on-brand social media presence.

              I worked at a London-based social media agency before taking the
              bold decision to set up my own freelance business in 2013. It’s
              been a fantastic journey, and I’ve met many wonderful people. I
              enjoy understanding businesses social media challenges, helping to
              simplify and demystifying social media while sharing my insights
              to help others reach their goals.
